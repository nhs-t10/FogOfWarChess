# FogOfWarChess
club project :)

hello guys im making a chess game that will be a multiplayer


you may have noticed that its called fog of war chess and not just chess

this is because the version of chess im creating is special, and centers around the idea that u can't see the squares on the board that your pieces aren't on or can't move to. 

This is a cool twist that I want to create
